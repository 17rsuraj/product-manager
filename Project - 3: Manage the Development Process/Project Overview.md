## Project Theme

Our projectâ€™s MVP scope has been translated into a PRD and is now ready to move into the development phase. 
Our development team has adopted Agile Scrum methodology principles to manage their development cycle. 
Each sprint runs for 2 weeks followed by a release to the production environment.

## Project Goal

1. Create a project blueprint that can be used by PM or the involved stakeholders to understand their role, task and targeted milestone.
2. Plan for a sprint meeting to ensure that the team is able to understand and focus on the deliverable.
3. Respond to different scenarios that may require PM to reprioritize the sprint backlog or manage expectations with stakeholders accordingly.
4. Understand the API documentation and use this information to engage with the scrum team accordingly.
