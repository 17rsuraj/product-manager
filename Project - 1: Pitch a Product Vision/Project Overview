# Project Theme

LinkedIn is trying to expand its job market offerings by creating an app that will recommend the best jobs to recent college graduates based on their skills and preferences.
Your team has been tasked with researching the market for this offering, the kinds of data needed, how to connect this with other LinkedIn offerings and how to best monetize it.

# Project Goal

To research this opportunity, create a pitch deck for the product you hope to build, and then present it.
