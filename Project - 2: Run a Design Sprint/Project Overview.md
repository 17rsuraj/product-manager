# Project Theme

For this project, you will be running a Design Sprint to further develop a concept to address the opportunity that you identified in the Project - 1. 
There are six phases of the Design Sprint. 
For this project there will also be two additional steps-- one optional step for iterating based on findings from user testing and one to prepare your concept for handoff.

# Project Goal

A Design Sprint is a cross-functional exercise with team members participating from a number of different roles across your company (Design, Product, Eng, Marketing, etc).

In this Design Sprint project, we’ll be going through the exercises on your own and we will simulate some of the group activities related to brainstorming.

The project consists of following Steps.

## Set the Stage
Start a PRD that can be shared with the team to set the stage about why this problem matters. The first part of the PRD will include:

- Any relevant background information
- A problem statement which communicates the scope of the problem
- Initial goals, which can continue to evolve throughout the project

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Understand

Create a shared understanding of the problem space and identify opportunities through a “How Might We” exercise.

### 1.1 Create at least 8 virtual stickies that ask questions following the "How Might We" model

- Opportunities. Not solutions.
- Not too broad, and not too narrow
- One idea per sticky

### 1.2 Get input from other members of your digital "team"

- Open the Google Slides deck that corresponds with your project
- Copy the slides back into your deck

### 1.3 Sort and group your stickies

- Group your stickies into clusters - Feel free to rearrange existing stickies or create new clusters and themes, if needed

### 1.4 Pick one theme that you want to move forward with and explain your rationale for selecting that theme

After finishing all the substeps in Understanding the problem, I created the stickies as below and grouped them together into clusters.
For moving ahead, I choose *Data Based Assistance* theme and it contains the stickies as shown below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Define
By defining and focusing on the desired outcomes, you’ll be able to more clearly understand how to get there.

### 2.1 Write a future press review

Think about how you want users to respond to your product:

- Who is it for?
- What problem does it solve?
- How does it change a customer’s life?
- Why should customers love it?

Use that information to draft a review from the perspective of the user

### 2.2 Define success metrics

Identify goals along with the signals and metrics that can be used to measure them using the HEART framework. This will be helpful later on, as you’ve already outlined what your project needs to do in order to be successful.

- Start by identifying at least two user-centered goals
- Then identify what signals from user behavior will affect reaching each specific goal
- Finally, create metrics derived from those signals can be measured

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Sketch
Generate ideas for possible solutions based on the theme that you selected.

### 3.1 Crazy 8's - Create 8 quick sketches to quickly generate a few ideas.

### 3.2 Pick two to develop into more detailed flows that clarify how the solution would work.

- Spend about 30 minutes per sketch
- Sketch your idea in more detail than the last exercise -- use text annotations if needed
- Create at least 3 frames that show how the user progresses through the flow
- Include a title

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Decide
Pick the final concept that you want to develop into a prototype

- Pick your most compelling solution sketch
- Explain why it’s the most compelling

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Prototype

Turn your concept into a realistic, interactive prototype that you will use to validate your assumptions and ideas

### 5.1 Storyboard

Create a storyboard based on your best solution sketch. We’ll use the storyboard as the blueprint to create the prototype.
The storyboard should:

**Be high fidelity enough to build a prototype:**
- Detail the steps a user goes through and how they progress from one step to the next
- Detail the layout of the software experience (wireframe level detail)

**Cover the entire user journey (ie: things that can happen outside the software experience)**
- What prompts the user to use this?

### 5.2 Prototype - Create an interactive prototype to showcase your concept

- Create mocks based on your storyboard using the [Figma prototyping tool](https://www.figma.com/prototyping/)
- Use the prototype tool to define the flows
- Describe the concept that your prototype captures
- Describe the flows/tasks a user can complete in your prototype

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Validate

Users will go through your prototype and provide feedback on your concept. This is also an opportunity to have an engineering feasibility discussion

### 6.1 Create a Research Plan

- Create a research plan
- Identify your target user
- Map out the flow of the interview
- - Intro
- - Background information
- - Tasks
- - Wrap Up

### 6.2 Run User Studies

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Handoff

- Refine the problem and goals section (if needed)
- Complete the Key Features and Scope section
- Link your mocks to the PRD
